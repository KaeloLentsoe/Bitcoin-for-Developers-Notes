# Introduction to Bitcoin Technology

We cover the basics of Bitcoin and open blockchain systems. This session will cover open, decentralized networks and how Bitcoin maintains a balance of power, what a Bitcoin actually is, the basics of network consensus, and more.

*This unit aims to provide you with a basic understanding of what Bitcoin is doing and how this open and decentralized system can function without centralized control.*

## 1.1: What is Bitcoin?

- Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. 

- Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. 

- The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.

- Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buying and selling goods, sending money to people or organizations, or extending credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.

**Bitcoin**:

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency system that enables the storage and transmission of value through units called bitcoins. It operates via a peer-to-peer network and is based on open-source software, making it accessible on various computing devices.

Users can transfer bitcoins for various purposes, similar to conventional currencies, with transactions facilitated by cryptographic keys stored in digital wallets. Bitcoin's decentralized nature eliminates the need for central authorities, with mining serving as the mechanism for issuing new bitcoins and validating transactions.

Bitcoin's innovations include a decentralized network, a public transaction ledger (blockchain), consensus rules for transaction validation and currency issuance, and a Proof-of-Work algorithm for decentralized consensus.

Preceding Bitcoin, early digital currencies were centralized and susceptible to governmental intervention. Bitcoin's decentralized design provides resilience against such control, representing a transformative innovation in digital currency.

# Depth

**Bitcoin** is a revolutionary digital currency system built upon a collection of concepts and technologies. At its core, Bitcoin offers a decentralized ecosystem for storing and transmitting value through units of currency called bitcoins. Participants in the Bitcoin network communicate with each other using the Bitcoin protocol primarily over the internet, though alternative transport networks are also viable. The Bitcoin protocol stack, available as open-source software, is compatible with various computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, ensuring widespread accessibility.

Bitcoin enables users to transfer bitcoins across the network for various purposes, akin to conventional currencies. Transactions include buying and selling goods, sending money to individuals or organizations, and extending credit. Specialized currency exchanges facilitate the purchase, sale, and exchange of bitcoins with other currencies. Notably, Bitcoin's characteristics—speed, security, and borderless nature—make it particularly suitable for internet-based transactions.

Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoins are entirely virtual, lacking physical or digital coins. Instead, transactions imply the transfer of value from sender to recipient. Users manage bitcoin ownership through cryptographic keys, which authenticate transactions. Possession of the appropriate key enables users to unlock and transfer bitcoins, with keys typically stored in digital wallets on computers or smartphones. This setup grants users complete control over their bitcoins, emphasizing individual autonomy.

Bitcoin operates as a distributed, peer-to-peer system without a central server or point of control. The creation of bitcoins, known as mining, occurs through a competitive process involving the verification of transactions and solving mathematical problems. Any participant in the Bitcoin network, equipped with the full protocol stack, can serve as a miner, contributing computational power to validate transactions. Miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins every 10 minutes on average. This decentralized mining process replaces the currency issuance and clearing functions typically managed by central banks.

The Bitcoin protocol incorporates algorithms regulating mining activity across the network. The difficulty of mining tasks adjusts dynamically to ensure a consistent issuance rate, with the total number of bitcoins capped at nearly 21 million. The protocol halves the rate of new bitcoin creation every 4 years, ensuring a predictable issuance schedule. Consequently, Bitcoin follows a deflationary model, and its supply cannot be arbitrarily inflated, distinguishing it from traditional fiat currencies.

Beyond its currency aspect, Bitcoin encompasses a broader innovation encompassing decentralized networks and distributed computing. Bitcoin represents the convergence of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems, amalgamating key innovations into a singular and potent framework. These innovations include a decentralized peer-to-peer network, a public transaction ledger (the blockchain), consensus rules for transaction validation and currency issuance, and a Proof-of-Work algorithm for global decentralized consensus.

Bitcoin, in essence, serves as the internet of money—a network for propagating value and securing digital asset ownership through distributed computation. This description merely scratches the surface of Bitcoin's multifaceted nature, with deeper layers of technology awaiting exploration.

## Digital Currencies Before Bitcoin
The evolution of viable digital money is closely intertwined with advancements in cryptography. Overcoming fundamental challenges inherent in representing value with bits necessitated innovative cryptographic solutions. Three primary concerns for digital money acceptance revolved around authenticity, double-spending prevention, and ownership verification.

Early digital currency endeavors emerged in the late 1980s, leveraging cryptography to issue digital money backed by national currencies or commodities like gold. Despite their functionality, these early digital currencies were centralized, rendering them susceptible to governmental intervention and hacking attempts. Centralized clearinghouses settled transactions, akin to traditional banking systems, making them vulnerable to regulatory crackdowns and abrupt liquidations.

Bitcoin emerged as a decentralized alternative, offering resilience against centralized control and single points of attack. Its decentralized design eliminates the need for central authorities, ensuring robustness against government interference or malicious actors. Bitcoin's decentralized architecture, coupled with cryptographic security, positions it as a transformative innovation in the realm of digital currencies."
