# Introduction to Bitcoin Technology

We cover the basics of Bitcoin and open blockchain systems. This session will cover open, decentralized networks and how Bitcoin maintains a balance of power, what a Bitcoin actually is, the basics of network consensus, and more.

*This unit aims to provide you with a basic understanding of what Bitcoin is doing and how this open and decentralized system can function without centralized control.*

## 1.1: What is Bitcoin?

- Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. 

- Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. 

- The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.

- Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buying and selling goods, sending money to people or organizations, or extending credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.

**Bitcoin**:

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency system that enables the storage and transmission of value through units called bitcoins. It operates via a peer-to-peer network and is based on open-source software, making it accessible on various computing devices.

Users can transfer bitcoins for various purposes, similar to conventional currencies, with transactions facilitated by cryptographic keys stored in digital wallets. Bitcoin's decentralized nature eliminates the need for central authorities, with mining serving as the mechanism for issuing new bitcoins and validating transactions.

Bitcoin's innovations include a decentralized network, a public transaction ledger (blockchain), consensus rules for transaction validation and currency issuance, and a Proof-of-Work algorithm for decentralized consensus.

Preceding Bitcoin, early digital currencies were centralized and susceptible to governmental intervention. Bitcoin's decentralized design provides resilience against such control, representing a transformative innovation in digital currency.
